Now that you‚Äôve acquainted yourself with Stacks, Queues, Lists and the like, it‚Äôs time to explore more complex data structures, and use them to solve more complicated tasks!

In this assignment, you‚Äôll work on the following features:

‚Ä¢ A Mountain Trail representation

‚Ä¢ A plot view that shows the longest trails suitable for a given hiker

‚Ä¢ A trip organiser that keeps track of the relative ranking of trips

In doing this, you‚Äôll need to demonstrate knowledge on the following topics:

‚Ä¢ Linked Structures

‚Ä¢ Hash Tables and their various methods / approaches

‚Ä¢ Use of recursive sorting algorithms and recursive methods

Assignment Project Exam Help

The only exception on this exception is that if you are essentially using a list as a stack then please use the provided LinkedStack instead.

Additionally, using with the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for this assignment is ENTIRELY

OPTIONAL, and is not guaranteed to work on all OSes. You shouldn‚Äôt need to look at main.py at all.

Please make sure to read the next slide for some important information before diving into the rest of the assignment.

Please read all instructions carefully. It is useful to have a general understanding of the app and of trails before you begin; however, you do not need a deep understanding to complete most of the tasks.

To reiterate what is said in the next slide, you do not need to read through or change the contents of main.py, draw_trails.py, or utils.py. Each task will specify what files need to be edited.

The template git repository can be found here. Follow the instructions in the

‚ÄúGetting Started with Git‚Äù document to copy across the repository (KEEPING IT Assignment Project Exam Help

PRIVATE) and get coding.

NOTE

The graph feature won‚Äôt work until you have implemented nearly everything (More Trail Methods, Mountain Manager, Mountain Organiser, Double Key Table)

This app gives information about a certain mountain range, which has various interconnected mountains.

Each mountain has three associated pieces of information:

‚Ä¢ The name of the mountain (text)

‚Ä¢ The difficulty level of climbing this mountain (integer)

‚Ä¢ The length across the mountain (integer)

This can be visualised nicely by main.py:

Assignment Project Exam Help

Each mountain is represented by the person walking up a hill icon, and the interconnected lines represent connections between mountains.

Here the red numbers on the left of each mountain represent the difficulty level, and the blue numbers on the right of each mountain represent the length.

As part of this assignment we‚Äôll be asking many queries about this collection of mountains.

On the right sidebar of the screen you‚Äôll see a few different buttons:

From top left to bottom right:

1. The plot icon shows a plot of mountains ranked by length as more difficulty levels are added. This is yet to be implemented, and is covered by Mountain Organiser and Manager.

2. The file icon allows you to save your current trail to a json file, which can be later loaded.

The final 4 icons are for selection modes, and once clicked change how you interact with the main view of the screen.

1. The pencil icon turns you into edit mode. Clicking on a mountain allows you to edit the difficulty, length, and name of the mountain.

2. The branch+ icon turns you into branch addition mode. Clicking on a straight horizontal line in the trail allows you to insert a branch.

3. The world+ icon turns you into mountain add mode. Clicking on a straight horizontal line in the trail allows you to insert a mountain.

4. The world- icon turns you into remove mode. Clicking on a branch or mountain in the trail allows you to remove that.

Finally, once you‚Äôve made some changes and used the save icon to save your changes to a json file, you can load them back up next time using a second argument to main.py. For example calling python main.py basic2.json gives:

What is a trail?

Wiktionary defines a trail as: A route for travel over land, especially a narrow, unpaved pathway for use by hikers, horseback riders, etc.

In this app a trail is a route both over and between mountains.

Motivating the basic components of a trail

The basic trail

The most simple form of a trail is:

1. A line with no mountain on it; or

2. A line with a mountain on it.

Assignment Project Exam Help

We can combine two trails to form a larger trail:

1. In parallel (Branching paths); or

2. In series (One after the other).

All possible trails can be generated by combining trails according to these rules.

Defining a Trail in Code

We can define a trail more formally using the following rules:

Trail is wrapper class* and takes exactly one argument. It can take one of the following objects: None, TrailSeries, or TrailSplit. These are typed as TrailStore in the code (this uses the typing Union, which means whenever we mention TrailStore, we are saying ‚Äúthis variable is either a TrailSeries, TrailSplit or None‚Äù). A Trail is represented by a Trail object containing some TrailStore, which might in turn contain more Trail objects in the hierarchy.

* For more information about wrappers, see this wiki article.

The simplest trail we can have is a line with no mountain.

‚Ä¢ This is the trail object Trail(None).

We can combine trails in sequence by having a mountain and a trail.

‚Ä¢ This is the TrailStore object TrailSeries(Mountain(name, difficulty, length), Trail(‚Ä¶)).

‚Ä¢ TrailSeries takes exactly two arguments.

‚Ä¢ The first argument must be a mountain, and this is the only way we can add a mountain to a trail.

‚Ä¢ The second argument is the remaining Trail that follows.

We can combine trails in parallel by having three trails: two which are in parallel, and the trail that follows.

‚Ä¢ This is the TrailStore object TrailSplit(Trail(info), Trail(info), Trail(info)).

‚Ä¢ TrailSplitAssignment Project Exam Help takes exactly three arguments.

‚Ä¢ The first argument is the trail that splits upwards

‚Ä¢ The second argument is the trail that splits downwards

Note that every Trail object in code has a store, which contains one of the 3 objects above. So for example, we could model the below image with the following object:

Assignment Project Exam Help

trail = Trail(TrailSplit(

Trail(TrailSplit( # The top branch

Trail(TrailSeries(

Trail(None),

)),

Trail(TrailSeries(

Mountain(‚Äútop-bot‚Äù, 3, 5),

Trail(None),

)),

Trail(TrailSeries(

Mountain(‚Äútop-middle‚Äù, 4, 7),

Trail(None),

)),

)),

Trail(TrailSeries( # The bottom branch

Mountain(‚Äúbottom-1‚Äù, 2, 5),

Trail(TrailSplit(

Trail(TrailSeries(

Mountain(‚Äúbottom-2‚Äù, 0, 0),

Trail(None),

)),

Trail(None),

Trail(None),

)),

)),

Trail(TrailSeries( # The following branch

Mountain(‚Äúfinal‚Äù, 4, 4),

Trail(None),

)),

))

Which also looks like the following memory diagram (click the image to enlarge):

[TASK] Trail creation &amp; Edit methods

It is highly recommend you fully read and understand the slide ‚ÄúWhat is a trail?‚Äù before continuing.

Complexity Analysis is not required for this taskAssignment Project Exam Help

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

The first task is to add a few helper methods to the Trail definitions in trail.py to

In trail.py, you‚Äôll find the following methods on a few different classes, already type hinted for you:

‚Ä¢ remove_branch

‚Ä¢ remove_mountain

‚Ä¢ add_mountain_before

‚Ä¢ add_empty_branch_before

‚Ä¢ add_mountain_after

‚Ä¢ add_empty_branch_after

These methods can be used to add and remove elements from the trail. They should not modify the existing Trail, but create new Trail objects representing what the trail would look like if edited.

If this method is defined on the Trail class, you should return a new Trail instance, which has completed the action specified.

If this method is defined on a TrailStore class, you should return a new TrailStore instance, which has completed the action specified.

For example, suppose we have the following:

a, b, c, d = (Mountain(letter, 5, 5) for letter in ‚Äúabcd‚Äù)

empty = Trail(None)

series_b = TrailSeries(b, Trail(TrailSeries(d, Trail(None))))

split = TrailSplit( empty, Trail(series_b),

Trail(TrailSeries(c, Trail(None)))

)

t = Trail(TrailSeries(

a,

Trail(split)Assignment Project Exam Help

))

This is represented by the following diagram:

Calling series_b.add_empty_branch_after() returns the following object:

TrailSeries( mountain=b,

following=Trail(store=TrailSplit( top=Trail(store=None), bottom=Trail(store=None), following=Trail(store=TrailSeries( mountain=d,

following=Trail(store=None)

))

))

)

While calling split.remove_branch should return the following object:

TrailSeries( mountain=c,

following=Trail(store=None)

)

And calling empty.add_empty_branch_before() should return the following object:

Trail(store=TrailSplit( top=Trail(store=None), bottom=Trail(store=None), following=Trail(store=None)

)) Assignment Project Exam Help

Tricks

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

trail.py

Now that we have defined our Trail objects, and can add extra objects on-top of them, we want to actually walk them!

Now since we have splits in the road, we must decide which path to take. That‚Äôs where Personalities come in!

A WalkerPersonality is a class that implements two methods:

‚Ä¢ add_mountain, which allows a Walker to note that mountain they‚Äôve just walked by

‚Ä¢ select_branch, which given two Trails as input, decides which of them they will take by returning the Enum PersonalityDecision. If STOP is returned, then neither branch should be taken and the path ends here.

Your task is to, without using recursion, implement the Trail method follow_path, which takes in an argument personality of type WalkerPersonality, and on your trail, calls personality.add_mountain for every mountain on your trail this walker personality would pass by.

For example, if personality defined select_branch as return

PersonalityDecision.TOP (Always choose the top (first) branch), then in the previous example:

We would call personality.add_mountain with Mountains named top-top, topmiddle and final .

For (somewhat) more complicated personalities, see personality.py.

[TASK] Double Keyed Table

In this task and the next, we‚Äôll be working on some Data Structures that take inspiration from Hash Tables but make some important changes to the way probing and storage are done. You‚Äôll use these structures to solve other problems later in the spec sheet.

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

double_key_table.py

For this first data structure, we‚Äôll be working on a Hash Table that takes two keys rather than one. In terms of storage, this can be thought of as a hash table of hash tables, where a top-level key is used to determine the first position (which hashtable to insert into) and a bottom-level key is used to determine where in this selected hashtable to insert into:

‚Ä¢ __init__(self, sizes=None, internal_sizes=None) , create the underlying array. If sizes is not None, the provided array should replace the existing TABLE_SIZES to decide the size of the top-level hash table. If internal_sizes

is not None, the provided array should replace the existing TABLE_SIZES for the internal hash tables (See hash_table.py for an example)). ‚Ä¢ _linear_probe(self, key1: K1, key2: K2, is_insert: bool) -&gt; tuple[int, int], return the:

o Index to access in the top-level table, followed by Index to access in the low-level table In a tuple.

‚Ä¢

o Your linear probe method should create the internal hash table if is_insert is true and this is the first pair with key1.

‚Ä¢ keys(self, key:K1|None = None) -&gt; list[K1|K2] o If key = None, return all top-level keys in the hash table

o If key != None, return all low-level keys in the sub-table of top-level key

‚Ä¢ values(self, key:K1|None = None) -&gt; list[V] o If key = None, return all values in all entries of the hash table

o If key != None, restrict to all values in the sub-table of top-level key

‚Ä¢ iter_keysAssignment Project Exam Help and iter_values: The same functionality as above, but this should return an iterator that yields the keys/values one by one rather than searching the entire table at the start. You should NOT get all the keys/values

‚Ä¢ __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__. When deleting, if the key1,key2 pair was the only key1 element in the table, you should clear out the entirety of that internal table so that a new key1 with the same hash can be inserted in that position. (See test_delete for more info.)

‚Ä¢ table_size(self) . Returns the current size of our table.

Tip: When creating a new internal hash table, be sure to set table.hash = lambda k:

self.hash2(k, table). This ensures any internal table uses hash2 for hashing keys.

[TASK] Infinite Depth Hash Table

This task is not part of the ‚ÄúSolo Standards‚Äù ‚Äì so if for whatever reason your group was split, you don‚Äôt have to submit this task.

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

infinite_hash_table.py

Time for another Hash Table implementation! This one is a bit different. We go back to having a single key, but rather than resolving collisions with probing, we resolve collisions by simply making more hash tables with new hash functions!

Your hash function will now use an instance variable called level. key is as it was before ‚Äì the key being inserted into the table. level specifies what level of the hash table hierarchy we are hashing for. This will become more obvious with a worked example. You can assume that all keys that go into this table are strings of lowercase english letters. Using the following hash function: class InfiniteHashTable

TABLE_SIZE = 27Assignment Project Exam Help

def hash(self, key: K) -&gt; int:

return ord(key[self.level]) % (self.TABLE_SIZE-1) return self.TABLE_SIZE-1

Next, after inserting mine and linked, mine would be inserted at the top level, and what was previously the location for lin now needs to be separated into a new table:

Next, adding limp and mining will first add limp in the table corresponding to li, while mining will split the location formerly hosting mine:

Finally, adding jake just sits at the top level (no collision), and adding linger navigates to the lin* table and inserts there:

Your task is to define the following methods for InfiniteHashTable:

‚Ä¢ __getitem__ : Retrieves a value based on it‚Äôs key.

‚Ä¢ __setitem__ : Sets a value based on the key.

‚Ä¢ __delitem__ : Remove a key/value pair. If this pair removed leaves only a single pair within the current table, then the current table should be collapsed to a single entry in the parent table (This should continue upwards until there is a table with multiple pairs or we are at the top table). See test_delete for an example.

‚Ä¢ get_location : Returns a list containing the indices required to retrieve a key. In the example above, get_location(linger) == [4, 1, 6, 25]

And finally, after you‚Äôve implemented everything from before, there‚Äôs one more function to implement: sort_keys. This function should return all keys that are currently in the table in lexicographically sorted order. Lexicographically sorted simply means that we compare a string letter by letter, and compare using the rule a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;d&lt;

And prefixes of text are always smaller than the full text.

[TASK] Mountain Organiser

O(1), even if they obviously are not.Assignment Project Exam Help

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

mountain_organiser.py

As you climb more and more mountains, you‚Äôd like to know the rank of each mountain, if all the mountains you‚Äôve seen are ranked by their difficulty increasing. In cases where the difficulty is the same, you should order them by name lexicographically increasing (you can assume this is unique)

To achieve this, we‚Äôd like you to implement the MountainOrganiser class (in mountain_organiser.py), which requires 3 methods:

‚Ä¢ __init__: Initialisation

‚Ä¢ add_mountains(self, mountains: list[Mountain]) -&gt; None: Adds a list of mountains to the organiser

‚Ä¢ cur_position(self, mountain: Mountain) -&gt; int: Finds the rank of the provided mountain given all mountains included so far. See below for an example. Raises KeyError if this mountain hasn‚Äôt been added yet.

Complexity Requirement

add_mountains should have complexity at most ( log‚Å°( )+ )O(Mlog(M)+N), where M is the length of the input list, and N is the total number of mountains included so far.

cur_position should have complexity at most (log‚Å°( ))O(log(N)), where N is the total number of mountains included so far.

Consider the following example:

See test_mountain_organiser.py for a code example of this diagram.

[TASK] Mountain Manager

This task is not part of the ‚ÄúSolo Standards‚Äù ‚Äì so if for whatever reason your group was split, you don‚Äôt have to submit this task.

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

mountain_manager.py

In order to make the graph view work, you‚Äôll need the Mountain Organiser implemented as well as this class: The Mountain Manager.

The mountain manager acts as a store which tracks all mountains in a trail (In other words, all mountains showing in main.py) and can be used to edit, add or remove mountains.

Mountains can also be filtered by difficulty, and a list of list containing all mountains, grouped by difficulty, in ascending order, can be generated.

On the file mountain_manager.py , implement the following methods:

‚Ä¢ __init__(self) -&gt; None: initialisation

‚Ä¢ add_mountain(self, mountain: Mountain) -&gt; None : Add a mountain to the manager

‚Ä¢ remove_mountain(self, mountain: Mountain) Assignment Project Exam Help-&gt; None: Remove a mountain from the manager

‚Ä¢ edit_mountain(self, old_mountain: Mountain, new_mountain: Mountain)

‚Ä¢ mountains_with_difficulty(self, diff: int) -&gt; list[Mountain]: Return a list of all mountains with this difficulty.

See tests/test_mountain_manager.py for an example of this in action.

[TASK] More Trail methods

Complexity Analysis is not required for this task

In this task, you‚Äôll be working on:

trail.py

Now that we can do anything we want in the main.py GUI, there‚Äôs a few more things we‚Äôd like to now about trails.

First off, we‚Äôd like to generate a list of all mountains contained within the Trail.

In trail.py, implement the method collect_all_mountains, which returns a list of Mountains that are within this trail. This should run in O(N) time, where N is the total number of mountains and branches combined.

Once you‚Äôve completed this, we‚Äôd also like to calculate all paths we could have taken through the trail, fitting some requirements.

In trail.py, implement the method difficulty_maximum_paths(self, diff: int) -&gt; list[list[Mountain]]. For this function, you can assume that no more than 5 branches are present in the trail used.

This method, when given an integer diff, should calculate all paths through the trail such that the maximum difficulty of all mountains in the path does not exceed diff. The return value of this should be a list containing lists, containing the Mountains on each path, in order taken in the path.

Paths are considered distinct if any branch decision chosen is different, even if the mountains traversed would be the same.

For example, for the following:Assignment Project Exam Help

Calling trail.difficulty_maximum_paths(5) should return a list of size 3, containing the following (in any order):

‚Ä¢ [bot-one, bot-two, final]

‚Ä¢ [bot-one, final]

‚Ä¢ [bot-one, final]

This is because any path taking the top branch must go through top-mid, with difficulty 7.

bot-one final is included twice because we can take either the top or bottom paths of the empty branch.
